I am currently an research associate at AI Lab, Samsung Research in Beijing, China. I work on machine learning and deep learning, among which machine learning mainly includes algorithms such as random forest and support vector machines.

Previously, I was an assistant professor at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China. I was a post-doc researcher at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium under the ERC Advanced Grant A-DATADRIVE-B hosted by Johan A.K. Suykens who has been elevated IEEE Fellow in 2015 for developing Least Squares Support Vector Machines, and is now hosting ERC Advanced Grant E-DUALITY. I received Ph.D. degree in machine learning from University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany in 2015, where I was fortunate to be advised by Ingo Steinwart who also serves as a faculty member in Machine Learning at the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems. Before that, I got M.S. degree in statistics and B.S. degree in applied mathematics from University of Stuttgart in 2010 and 2007, respectively.
